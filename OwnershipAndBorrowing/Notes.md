## Intro
- basic understing of Ownership is require.
- no need to understand memory layer
- all Rust libraries and community can help us.
## Scope
- lexical or aka static scoping is when variable can accessible in the scope they are defined in.
- accessible only in inside a function.
- outer scope cannot see inner scope variables.
- Shadowing is allow > resuing same variables in the same scope.
- Related to scopes, Rust supports shadowing.
  - Shadowing allows reusing the same variable name for another variable.
  - Shadowing a variable from the outer scope inside a subscope does not change the variable.
