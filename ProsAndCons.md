## Pros and Cons of Rust

- Upsides
  - Rust is performant
  - Zero cost abstractions make efficient code quick and easy to write
  - Compiled programs execute fast
  - No garbage collector
    - The only checks during runtime are for index out of bounds
- Ergonomic error handling
  - Recoverable errors are handled using types
  - Parts of the program that can fail are easy to spot
- Rust is (memory) safe
  - Rust compiler ensures no memory bugs can happen during runtime
    - Unless explicitly using unsafe code for advanced low-level operations
  - Safe and efficient concurrency
- Has a vibrant community that pushes the language and its utilities forward
  - An extensive standard library
  - Many useful libraries
- Highly integrated package manager
- Helpful compiler
  - Not only complains about your mistakes, but suggests fixes
- Downsides
  - Rust is verbose
    - Some basic operations require more code than many other languages
  - Compilation times can be slow
  - Writing code can often be slower than in many other contemporary languages
    - The programmer needs to work with a very strict rule set enforced by the compiler
  - Requires learning a unique programming paradigm.
