## Static typing
- Rust is a strictly statically typed language. This means that.
  - ans: every variable type needs to be known at compile time.
## Valid variable types
- Select the option that does NOT result in an error in a Rust program.
  - let i32 = 43; // beause i32 is not a type but auto variable
  - let money:f64 = 2.718; // because we explicitly define type
